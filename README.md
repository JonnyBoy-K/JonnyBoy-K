## Hey there! 👋  
I’m Jonny, a computer science major studying at the University of Saskatchewan.  

I typically work on/build web apps and games, but I plan to branch out to other types of projects as well.

For web based projects, my main tech stack is React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Node.js (Express) and Prisma (PostgreSQL) + Docker. I also make use of figma for UI prototyping and clerk for authentication.  
For games I use the Godot game engine with GDScript.  
I also have experience coding with java, python, C and Golang on smaller class/personal projects.  

I’m currently working with a team of 7 others on a 2D agent sim/dungeon builder game called Crypt Keeper. My role on the team is as a test lead which includes the responsibilities of ensuring our programmers are using a TDD approach, managing the user and playability testing of our game including write ups on bugs and assisting the project lead in between test cycles.
